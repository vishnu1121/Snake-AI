# Snake-AI
This project is a self-directed learning initiative that combines classic game development with modern reinforcement learning techniques. It features a fully functional Snake game built using Python and Pygame, along with an AI agent trained using PyTorch and Deep Q-Learning (DQL) to play the game autonomously.
